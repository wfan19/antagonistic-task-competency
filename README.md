# README
This is the repository for the submitted Robosoft 2025 paper "A Fast and Model Based Approach for Evaluating Task-Competence of Antagonistic Continuum Arms", as well as the [SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION pdf](/SUPPLEMENTARY_INFORMATION.pdf), which contains the in-coordinate form of the mechanics model, proofs of lemmas used in the paper, and more.

This repository contains everything for reproducing the results in the paper:

- Matlab livescripts for generating all figures have "FIGURE" or "RESULTS" in the title - just make sure to add the `include` directory to the path.
- Figure SVG source files are included in the [figures](/figures) directory
- Datasets and post-processing code for actuator models can be found in the [SI_bellow_model_fitting](/SI_bellow_model_fitting/) directory.
- CAD files for renderings are in the [CAD](/CAD/) directory
